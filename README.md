# What-Can-You-Learn-From-a-Dataset-on-iTunes-Podcasts

This is my final project for my data analysis course. I cleaned and merged iTunes podcast datasets then used sentiment and statistical analysis 
to get some insights on trends of podcast listening. The html file is the rendered file of the rmd script. 

The original podcast datasets were found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews?resource=download
and https://github.com/odenizgiz/Podcasts-Datadataset
